<b>ATTENTION:</b> Due to incorrect device name in the new TWRP which causes flashing issues, we have decided to restore fastboot ROM releases for Redmi K40 Pro/+/Mi 11i (haydn) until TWRP developer fixes that problem.<br><br>
<b>Starting from 22.6.22 release, we have released the recovery packages for some devices, because there are working TWRP releases for them.</b><br>
<b>For non-A/B devices,</b> like Mi 10, you have to flash recovery from the fastboot mode, then reboot using the "fastboot reboot-recovery" command, then flash the ROM; TWRP will not be replaced automatically unless you flash the new, working recovery.<br>
<b>For A/B devices,</b> like Mi 11, you have to boot recovery from fastboot only, then flash the new release; TWRP will be replaced automatically.<br><br>
<br>
<b>Starting from 18 July 2022, there will be no Weekly ROMs for the following devices: Mi CC9 Pro/Mi Note 10/Pro, Mi 10, Mi 10 Pro, Mi 10 Lite Zoom, Redmi K30, Redmi K30 5G, Redmi K30i 5G, Redmi K30 Pro/POCO F2 Pro.</b><br>

<b>This changelog doesn't mention all changes made by Xiaomi.eu or Xiaomi.</b><br>
