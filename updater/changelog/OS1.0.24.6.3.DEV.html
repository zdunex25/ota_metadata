<b>Notes</b><br>
<new>New</new> - You can generate AI-based summaries from texts and links now in Quick notes (Xiaomi 14/Pro)<br>
<b>Note:</b> If you use a link to generate summary, you will often receive stuff in Chinese. To ensure that you receive a response in the original language, we recommend copying the text rather than using the link. It's quite possible that AI won't produce summaries of news that the Chinese government finds sensitive.<br><br>
<b>Notification shade</b><br>
<fix>Fix</fix> - Clock and date was missing in horizontal mode<br>

<b>This changelog doesn't mention all changes made by Xiaomi.eu or Xiaomi.</b><br>
