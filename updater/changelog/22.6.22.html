<b>For A/B devices,</b> like Mi 11, you have to boot recovery from fastboot only, then flash the new release; TWRP will be replaced automatically.<br><br>
<b>Warning:</b> Standard Android bubble notifications (not the new ones) on apps like Messenger or Telegram don't work properly on this build.<br>
